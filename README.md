# Automated Inebriation Detection System

The **Automated Inebriation Detection System** is a proactive solution designed to detect signs of intoxication in real-time using facial analysis, behavioral patterns, and physiological indicators. This system leverages machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to classify individuals as sober or intoxicated, aiming to prevent drunk driving incidents and enhance road safety. The project integrates IoT components like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and sensors (camera and MQ-3 alcohol sensor) for real-time monitoring and intervention.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors facial cues, behavioral patterns, and alcohol levels.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Random Forest and Logistic Regression for accurate classification.
- **IoT Integration**: Combines Arduino, Raspberry Pi, camera, and MQ-3 alcohol sensor for real-time data collection and processing.
- 
## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression (implemented using Scikit-learn).
- **IoT Hardware**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi 5, MQ-3 alcohol sensor, camera sensor.
- **Programming Language**: Python (for model training and evaluation).
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Joblib.
- **Data Sources**: Sober and drunk datasets from Kaggle.
